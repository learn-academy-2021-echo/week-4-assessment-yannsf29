# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
 Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: “Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

  Researched answer:

“Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

But the important part here is that data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow. (one way from parent to child)
Furthermore, props data is read-only, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components.




2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: DOM event is an action when the user actually take action on the interface.

  Researched answer: HTML DOM events allow JavaScript to register different event handlers on elements in an HTML document.

Events are normally used in combination with functions, and the function will not be executed before the event occurs (such as when a user clicks a button).



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer:   a float would be a number with a decimal (2.5) and integer would be a plain number like (10)

  Researched answer:

  A floating-point number or a float represents a real number. ... Ruby will consider any number written without decimals as an integer (as in 138 ) and any number written with decimals as a float (as in 138.0 ).



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer:  Ruby will return the last result of the expression unless an explicit return comes before it.

  Researched answer:

Ruby methods ALWAYS return the evaluated result of the last line of the expression unless an explicit return comes before it. If you wanted to explicitly return a value you can use the return keyword.

We know that methods in Ruby can return values, and we ask a method to return a value when we want to use it in another part of our program.

For instance, if you don’t tell a JavaScript function exactly what to return, it’ll return undefined. For Python, the default return value is None. But for Ruby, it’s something different: Ruby’s methods will return the result of the last evaluated expression.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: In object-oriented programming with classes, an instance variable is a variable defined in a class (i.e. a member variable), for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance. An instance variable has similarities with a class variable, but is non-static.

2. PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL is used as the primary data store or data warehouse for many web, mobile, geospatial, and analytics applications. The latest major version is PostgreSQL 12.

3. Ruby on Rails: Ruby on Rails is an open-source software used to build web applications. Rails is a framework used to create websites using the general-purpose programming language Ruby. Ruby ranks amongst the top ten programming languages predominantly because of the voguishness of Rails.

4. ORM: Object-relational mapping (ORM) is a programming technique in which a metadata descriptor is used to connect object code to a relational database. Object code is written in object-oriented programming (OOP) languages such as Java or C#.

5. Active Record: Active Record is the M in MVC - the model - which is the layer of the system responsible for representing business data and logic. Active Record facilitates the creation and use of business objects whose data requires persistent storage to a database.
